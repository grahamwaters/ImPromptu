- Editing existing prompts
- Other things you can think of... :)

For those unfamiliar with GitHub, here is a quick guide on how to contribute to the project:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Create a new branch
4. Make your changes
5. Commit your changes
6. Push your changes to your fork
7. Create a pull request

Message one of the contributors if you need help with any of these steps.
